          <p>I love reading manga and watching anime.</p>
          <p>It has been a part of my life since the beginning and has surprisingly taught me alot.</p>
          <p>I first started off watching pokemon on television as a small child and later found myself indulging in wider categories and genres of anime.</p>
          <p>I even ended up reading the source material of many anime even though I didnt really enjoy reading at the time.</p>

        <td colspan="2"><h2>Animation</h2>
          <p>With my love of anime i have deveolped a passion for animation and animating as well.</p>
          <p>What started off as a hobby of sketching frame by frame "doodles" in a flipbook ended up turning</p>
          <p>into 3d movement animation using blender and other softwares.</p>

        <td colspan="2"><h2>Music</h2>
          <p>I love music and if not all, most people do as well.</p>
          <p>I enjoy not only listening to music, but making it as well.</p>
          <p>I started learning to play the saxophone in highschool and then went on to learn piano and bass as well. </p>
          <p>I spend some of my free time getting better at the instruments I play and learning new ones on the way.</p>

          <p>If answered properly I believe the Keirsey Temperament Sorter truly does do a</p>
          <p>good job at evaluating and figuring out the characteristics and traits of people.</p>
          <p>When I attempted the experiment I ended up recieved the artisan title which I</p>
          <p>found to be fairly accurate based on the descriptions given to them by the site.</p>
