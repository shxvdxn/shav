          <h4>The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.</h4>
            <p>In chapter 4 they essentially talked about how goal setting is deciding where you want </p>
            <p>to go and then designing a plan to get you there. Setting goals that stretch you and make you do things </p>
            <p>differently is what will lead you to a future that you want.  Don’t wait for people to set goals for you.</p>
            <p>Without setting goals in my life I would not have reached where am today because i would not have</p>
            <p>known what to work towards.</p>

          <h4>Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.</h4>
          <p>The pain of discipline weighs ounces while the pain of regret weighs tons.</p>
          <p>You should spend your time on the opportunities that align with your overall goals.</p>
          <p>Dont waste your time on trivial things but those that are important.</p>
          <p>I have been taught this my entire life by my parents and are greatful to them</p>
          <p>because it is a very important piece of advice that can put you on the right tracts.</p>

          <h4>Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.</h4>
          <p>Identify the people around you, evaluate them and check to see what impact they are having on you.</p>
          <p>Be mindful of the people around and make sure they are people that will push you, challenge you</p>
          <p>and encourage you to become better. To attract attractive people, you must be attractive.</p>
          <p>I have always followed these steps in life by distancing myself from negativity and gravitaing</p>
          <p>towards positivity keeping in mind that i must treat other how i would like to be treated.</p>

          <h4>Formal education will make you a living.  Self education will make you a fortune.</h4>
          <p>Self-education is what you teach yourself. It is what you learn along the way so </p>
          <p>that you are constantly improving and growing.</p> 
          </p>To separate yourself from everyone else, be focused on continuous learning.</p>
          <p>Most of life is lived after your formal education. That means the rest of it is up to you.</p>
          <p>To apply this, I spend the "free-time" I have to learn different things.</p>
